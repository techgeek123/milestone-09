# MileStone-8 : Cube Timer
 
## Release 0 : What's a Cube Timer? 
Competitive Rubik's Cube solving is a [real thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xcpauirEZQ). We want to build a timer web app that people can use to record and save their solve times. 

## Release 1 : Let's see some Cube Timers

[Here](https://ruwix.com/online-rubiks-stopwatch-timer/) are some [examples](https://cstimer.net/) of [Cube Timers](https://www.cubemania.org/puzzles/3x3x3/timer). Go through these sites and observe the features they provide. Make a list of all the features each one has. Ask yourself the following questions: 
- Which are the must have (core) features? 
- Which are the optional features? 
- Which UI do you like the best? Why?
- How would you design the interface? 
- What all is it recording? Is the app storing any data? If so, is it permanent or temporary? How do you know?

## Release 2 : Features and Flow
Here is where you create your Cube Timer app along with all its features, versions, UI, functionality etc. 

- Think of what all you need to build 
- How does the flow for the timer work? 
- What all technologies/platforms will you need to achieve this?
- How do you want the Front End to look? What all do you need to build on the Front End? 
- Think of the little details. Does it work only on click or does it also work on some key press?
- If you refresh or close and open the app, does it save the timings already recorded or are they discarded? 
- Once you sign up or login, it saves your timings permanently, how do we achieve this? 
- Most of these sites also allow us to download the logs in various formats. How will we build this?

## Release 3 : Version-ing 
It is compulsory for this MileStone to make versions and use Trello. Your webapp needs to be divided into various versions with appropriate features. Do not start coding till you have done this. Take some time and create the 0.1,0.2, MVP etc. 

Divide the work between you and your pair. How will you merge the FE and the BE once you're done? You should ideally have goals set in your versions where you can sync up your code and test that everything is working fine. 

Breaking up the app will help you do this smoothly. 

Also use Git branching and merging. It's a good opportunity to test your knowledge of git workflow and get some hands on experience with advanced git working.
